### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm Alex Carpenter,

### What hardware do you use?

I do all of my work and play on a 13-inch Macbook Air. When at work I hook into a 32-inch exteranl Mac display and make use of a Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard.

### And what software?

I have mode between text editors far to often. Lately I have moved back to Sublime Text 3. I was working in Atom for awhile but found the startup time a lot slower than Sublime. I switch between projects quite often so being able to open up files/projects quickly is essential to staying sane.

### What would be your dream setup?
