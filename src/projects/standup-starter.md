In an effort to learn React, I took some time to build a small app inspired by a co-workers Vue.js implementation. The basic idea was to create an app to help us decide who starts off our daily standups.

The project was kickstarted using [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/), styled with [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/), and persisted data via [React Simple Storage](https://github.com/ryanjyost/react-simple-storage).
