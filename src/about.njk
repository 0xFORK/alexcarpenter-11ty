Throughtout the past five years i've worked professionally as a hybrid front-end developer/designer. Working confidently throughout the stack to produce semantic <a href="/posts/tagged/accessiblity/">accessible</a> markup, with modular <a href="/posts/tagged/css/">CSS</a>, and progressively enhance the experience with unobtrusive <a href="/posts/tagged/javascript/">JavaScript</a>.

I live in Grand Rapids, Michigan âœ‹, with my wife and our puppy, where we spend our time fly fishing, hiking, and seeking adventures offline.
