Six years ago I started the [I Brew My Own Coffee Podcast](http://www.ibrewmyowncoffee.com/episodes). At that time I purchased an [Audio-Technica AT2020 USB mic](https://amzn.to/36JEG8t) because of its plug and play capabilities.

Since that podcast I have used that same mic to produce web development screencasts on YouTube. Its worked well, but I was looking to upgrade my setup. I'd been watching a lot of YouTube videos on microphones and learned about the differences between condenser and dynamic microphones.

Dynamic microphones are used more often in broadcasting situations. The most popular mic in this category is the Shure SM7B. At a hefty price tag, I knew I needed to find a more affordable option.
