title: Optimizing my keyboard for efficiency

I recently watched a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emNG5DuEzaY) by John Lindquist, expressing the importance of typing skills to become a more efficient developer. In this video, he demonstrates the use of Karabiner-Elements to be able to remap keys on your keyboard.

This led me down the rabit hole of how I can start optimizing my keyboard to better suit my needs. The first thing I did was increase my *Key Repeat* setting and shorten the *Deley Until Repeat* as well. These can be found in your system preferences. I am not sure why I never did this before, but navigating via my arrow keys was terribly slow, so I tended to use my mouse quite often instead. With that update, I am able to navigate text much more efficiently via my keyboard.

Next thing I did was download [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/). With that installed, I installed a *complex modification* that allows me to navigate via the [[h]] [[j]] [[k]] [[l]] keys when pressed in combination with the [[caps lock]] key. This gives me Vim type navigation without having to toggle between modes. I also remapped my left and right [[shift]] keys to be *delete_forward* and *delete_or_backspace* when pressed alone.

These two modifications help keep my hands on the home row of my keyboard, which in theory, is more efficient. I feel like I am just scratching the surface of what is possible with Karabiner-Elements.
