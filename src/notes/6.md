The past few months I've noticed this trend of cheeky remarks on Twitter about the tooling folks choose to use to build their own personal site/blog. I've had to start muting a few individuals â€“ all who I have enjoyed following over the years because of their mostly positive contributions to the community.

My personal website has been the biggest source of learning over the years. It has gone through many iterations and technology stacks, all for the sake of learning and exploration. So it is frustraiting when I hear people discouraging others from using a certain tool to build their own site.

Please feel free to choose whatever tool you want to build your own personal site. I know the positive impact these experiments can have on your career.
